# Summary of ML 101

## What is Machine Learning

- ML make computer act as human
- Make computer learn through statistic and pattern using data and algorithm
- We need a lot trial and error to train our model

## AI/Data Science/ML

- Narrow AI = one specific intelligence
- ML = subset of AI (Make computer do thing without we program it)
- Deep Learning = one of technique in ML
- Data Science = Often overlapping with ML
- Data Engineering

## ML Playground

## How is Machine Learning Useful

- Excel and CSV start the day
- Save the Data into DB Relational
- Save the Data to No SQL because data is too large (Big Data)
- We need ML to analyze it because it is too big

## Type of ML

- Supervised (Classification)
- Unsupervised (Clusterring)
- Reinforcement (Real time learning, Skill Acquisition)
