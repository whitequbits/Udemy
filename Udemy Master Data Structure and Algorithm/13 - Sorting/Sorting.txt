Sorting is one of algorithm in CS
There are few of sorting algorithm

Best Sorting Algorithm, based on the case
(https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)

1. Random Data
  Fastest : 
  Heap Sort,
  Time Complexity Worse : O(n log(n))
  Space Complexity Worse : O(1)

2. Nearly Sorted
  Fastest : 
  Insertion Sort, 
  Time Complexity Worse : O(nˆ2)
  Space Complexity Worse : O(1)

3. Reversed
  Fastest : 
  Shell Sort, 
  Time Complexity Worse : O((n log(n))ˆ2)
  Space Complexity Worse : O(1)

4. Few Unique
  Fastest : 
  Quick 3 Sort,
  Time Complexity Worse : O(nˆ2)
  Space Complexity Worse : O(log(n))

Conclusion :
There is no best algorithm in sorting, and it depend on the situation

A stable sorting algorithm is the one that sorts the identical elements in their same order as they appears in the input, whilst unstable sorting may not satisfy the case.

Stable Sorting Algorithms:

Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Bubble Sort
Tim Sort
Counting Sort

Unstable Sorting Algorithms:

Heap Sort
Selection sort
Shell sort
Quick Sort
